#  BigID Community Content
</br>Welcome to the community content repository!
Since we want you to fell at home, we have decided to avoid long procedures. However , in order to avoid a mess, some minnal guidelines are requiered...

***

## Best practices
**Secrets** - Do not push secrets. Pay attention that secrets are still availeable in git log, no matter if you deleted them in a later commit.</br>
**Language** - Although we appreciate any contribution, we prefer Pyhton 3.x</br>
**Notify content maintainers** - When issuing a pull request, please add an admin **and the original developer** of the tool you are changing  as reviewers.</br>
**Testing** - Test your stuff and provide a README.</br>
**Packaging** - Dockerize your code, else supply an installation script or installation instructions for all dependencies.</br>
</br></br>


## Naming and Coding Conventions
- Use snake_case for functions and variable names:
```python
creation_date = entry['created_at']
```
- Use SNAKE_CASE for global variables:
```python
BIGID_API_USER = os.environ['BIGID_API_USER']
```
- Catch exceptions:
```python
try:
    response = requests.put(
        url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, verify=False)
    # Check for HTTP codes other than 200
    if response.status_code != 200:
            print('Status:', response.status_code, "Operation failed!")
    else:
            print(response.status_code, "Task closed!")
except Exception:
    print("Something went wrong. Is BigID up?", sys.exc_info())
```

</br>In general, try to follow the pep8 style guide (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
